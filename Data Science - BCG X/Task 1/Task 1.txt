Subject: PowerCo Churn Analysis – Data Needs and Approach

Respected AD,

Estelle and I have outlined our approach to investigate PowerCo’s customer churn using the 5-step data science process:

1. Define the Problem:
PowerCo wants to understand why customers are leaving and identify key factors driving churn.

2. Collect the Data:
We will need:

Customer demographics and location
Energy usage history (past 5 years)
Pricing and contract details
Churn status (active/inactive)
Customer service logs
Survey/feedback data
Marketing campaign exposure
Competitor pricing (if available)

3. Prepare the Data:
Clean, format, and engineer features like tenure, complaint frequency, and monthly spend.

4. Analyze the Data:
Use statistical analysis, visualizations, and machine learning (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) to identify churn drivers.

5. Communicate Findings:
Summarize insights using dashboards, churn prediction models, and recommend retention strategies.

Key churn factors likely include: price, clean energy options, customer service quality, and location.

Kind regards,
Hanni
