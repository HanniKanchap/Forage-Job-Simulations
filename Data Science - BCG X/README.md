# 🔍 Data Science Virtual Experience – BCG X (Forage)

Welcome to the BCG X Data Science Virtual Experience! This project is part of a simulation hosted by Forage and designed by Boston Consulting Group (BCG X), focused on real-world data challenges faced by leading global companies. The goal: deliver impactful insights through data exploration, analysis, and storytelling.

## 📁 Project Overview

This repository contains my submissions and project artifacts from the **Data Science virtual job simulation by BCG X**. The tasks simulate challenges a BCG data scientist might encounter, including:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Model development and evaluation
- Communicating insights to non-technical stakeholders

## 🧠 What I Did

- Conducted detailed EDA to identify trends, anomalies, and business-relevant patterns
- Built predictive models to support data-driven decision-making
- Visualized key insights with clear, compelling charts
- Developed a concise executive summary highlighting data-backed strategies


## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub for version control

## 🎯 Key Learnings

- Translating messy data into actionable insights
- Balancing analytical depth with business communication
- Building models aligned with stakeholder goals
- Delivering high-impact visual storytelling

## 📌 About the Program

This simulation is offered by [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/) in partnership with **BCG X** to help aspiring data scientists experience life inside a global consulting firm. It's completely free and open to students and professionals seeking hands-on exposure.
